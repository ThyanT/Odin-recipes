              <li><b>Mix dry ingredients.</b> In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</li>
              <li><b>Mix wet ingredients.</b> In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.</li>
              <li><b>Combine wet and dry ingredients.</b> Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened. (Do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine.)</li>
              <li><b>Heat and oil skillet or griddle.</b> Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.</li>
              <li><b>Spoon batter onto skillet or griddle.</b> For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</li>
              <li><b>Cook first side.</b> Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
              <li><b>Flip pancakes.</b> Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
              <li><b>Serve immediately, or keep warm in oven.</b> Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.</li>
